# Woodworking at FreeCAD - examples

Idea behind this examples folder is to have fully parametric furniture examples that can be quickly resized via `settings` spreadsheet and adopted to the current project. You can change any size at `settings` spreadsheet and the furniture will change dimensions automatically (in some cases recompute might be needed). All the examples are built in the supported way by [getDimensions](https://github.com/dprojects/getDimensions) macro tool. So, You can generate new report with new dimensions. This approach will be more useful for future projects than static examples, I guess.
