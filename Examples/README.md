# Woodworking at FreeCAD - fully parametric examples

Idea behind this examples folder is to have fully parametric furniture examples that can be quickly resized via `settings` spreadsheet and adopted to the current project. You can change any size at `settings` spreadsheet and the furniture will change dimensions automatically (in some cases recompute might be needed). Also, You can generate new report with new dimensions.

All the examples here should follow the rules:
* Fully parametric as much as possible.
* Should be built in the supported way by [getDimensions](https://github.com/dprojects/getDimensions) macro tool. 

This approach will be more useful for future projects than static examples, I guess.
