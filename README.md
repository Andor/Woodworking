# Tools included

* [getDimensions](https://github.com/dprojects/getDimensions) - creates spreadsheet with dimensions to cut (BOM button).
* [sheet2export](https://github.com/dprojects/sheet2export) - export spreadsheet to chosen file format (HTML button).
* [scanObjects](https://github.com/dprojects/scanObjects) - inspection tool for FreeCAD macro development & project debug (CODE button).

**Note:** Tools included in this workbench may not be upd-to-date. To update any of the tool just overwrite it with new version. All the tools will be developed separately because you may not want to use whole workbench, but only one macro e.g. [scanObjects](https://github.com/dprojects/scanObjects).
